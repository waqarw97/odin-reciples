        <h4>This salad recipe isn't half bad. I think my wife made a better salad, but I'll never be able to try that again so this will have to cut it.</h4>
        <p>Traditional Caesar salad that uses kale instead of romaine! Makes 4 side-dish portions, but you can make it a main dish meal by topping it with a grilled protein, such as chicken or salmon! You may have leftover dressing, depending on how much you like. It keeps well in the refrigerator for up to a week.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
            <li>3 cloves, garlic minced</li>
            <li>2 oil packed anchovy fillets</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Dijon Mustard</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 bunch kale, ribs removed and leaves torn into pieces</li>
            <li>1 cup Caesar salad croutons</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Place mayonnaise, lemon juice, garlic, anchovies, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper in the bowl of a food processor. Process until smooth. Transfer to a small bowl and stir in grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Place kale in a large salad bowl. Using your hands, massage the kale to soften slightly. Add a few dollops of the dressing on top of the kale, and stir until all pieces are lightly coated with the dressing. Sprinkle with croutons and top with shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</li>
        </ol>
